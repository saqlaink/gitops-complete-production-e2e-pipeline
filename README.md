# GitOps Deployment Pipeline for Complete Production Environment

## Overview

This repository complements the [Complete Production E2E Pipeline](https://github.com/saqlaink/complete-production-e2e-pipeline), facilitating end-to-end deployments in a complete production environment. The Jenkins pipeline, configured separately, automates deployment processes based on GitOps principles.

## Associated Jenkins Pipeline

Find the associated Jenkins pipeline [here](https://github.com/saqlaink/complete-production-e2e-pipeline/blob/main/Jenkinsfile), which orchestrates the deployment processes for this application repository.

## GitOps Deployment Flow

This repository adheres to GitOps practices and integrates with the Jenkins pipeline to execute the following steps:

### 1. Cleanup Workspace

- Initializes a clean workspace to commence the GitOps-driven deployment process.

### 2. Checkout from SCM (Source Control Management)

- Pulls the latest codebase from the specified GitHub repository branch (`main`) using provided credentials.

### 3. Update Deployment Configuration

- Modifies the `deployment.yaml` file, ensuring adherence to GitOps principles, by updating deployment tags associated with the application name.

### 4. Commit Changes to GitOps Repository

- Commits the modified `deployment.yaml` file to the GitOps repository's `main` branch, enabling version-controlled and auditable changes.

### 5. Post-Build Actions and GitOps Sync

- After deployment completion, a Slack notification is dispatched to a designated channel, providing deployment status (Success, Failure, or Unknown), job name, build number, and a link for additional insights.
- Automatically syncs the GitOps repository with the changes, ensuring the actual system state aligns with the desired state specified in the repository.

## Usage

To effectively utilize this GitOps-driven Jenkins pipeline:

1. **Set Up Jenkins Environment:** Ensure you have a Jenkins instance configured.
2. **Configure Pipeline Parameters:** Customize pipeline parameters like GitHub credentials and repository URL for seamless integration.
3. **Trigger GitOps Deployment:** Initiate the pipeline to automate GitOps-based end-to-end deployments.

## Recommendations and Considerations

- **GitOps Configuration:** Verify that GitOps principles are followed, allowing the repository to be the single source of truth for the desired system state.
- **Environment Variables:** Customize the `APP_NAME` and `IMAGE_TAG` environment variables according to project-specific requirements.
- **Monitoring and Observability:** Regularly monitor the Slack channel for real-time deployment status and access detailed build information.

## Contribution and Enhancements

Feel free to contribute, improve, or tailor this GitOps Jenkins pipeline.
